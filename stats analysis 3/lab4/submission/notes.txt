Part 1: 3 Marks. Part 1 meets basic requirements of reading in data, formatting date, extracting relevant range, plotting data and writing to pdf. Comments are appropriate Text of main and axis titles is correct, but could elevate by changing text size as in example graph. Line colours and type are correct except green line should be dotted Part 2: 2.5 Marks. Part 2 meets basic requirements of creating requested plot and saving to pdf Comments appropriate No main title, and could have removed "." from variable names. Separate trend lines per species is good, could mention in text/legend in graph Part 3: 2.5 Marks. Part 3 meets basic requirements of creating a boxplot using the diamonds data Comments appropriate Informative title etc Note that legend is redundant Could elevate with perhaps more detail, eg colour by a third variable Part 4: 3 Marks. Part 4 meets basic requirements of creating a graph from the diamond dataset and commenting on the choice of graph No main title Decent level of complexity Could elevate with further customisation

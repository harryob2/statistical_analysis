I accidentally submitted the last time, which was on time, without first saving the file. I had updated the code but when I submitted that to blackboard those updates weren't included because I didn't save. This new submission is my final one. :)

Part 1

2.5

"Lacking in detail

Appreciate discussion of computational issues

Outliers discussed

Choice of distance ; linkage, standardisation, not discussed

K-medoids vs k-means etc not discussed

Model based clustering not discussed"

Part 2

2

"Needs justification of distance/linkage choices

could do more with post-cluster analysis - eg what do the clusters have in common? "

Part 3

Reasonable effort. Could have gone into a little more detail on where the differences between methods occurred i.e which observations changed groups. Could have given more discussion of results of post-cluster analysis

Complete. Re: Gap statistic, you're on the right track, see general feedback (harry: i have no idea what shes on about here with general feedback, went looking but think she forgot)

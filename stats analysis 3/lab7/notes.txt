All three models presented, with measures of performance shown. 

Overall conclusion is supported by the analysis (though on what basis are you deciding they are not as good as a doctor - we do not know how classification was ultimately performed, could be historic data)

Regsubsets included

Appreciate critical thinking in terms of performance metrics with consideration of dataset.



Report lacks introduction to dataset and purpose of modelling. Include figures for dataset size, % allocated to training/validation/test, thresholds.

Appreciate inclusion of coefficients, could elevate by further discussion same - which are most important?

Brief discussion of the various methods would elevate.

man i honestly was so clueless for this assignment. i just had no idea what she wanted. i had resigned to get maybe a 2.1 because i was just exhausted from my other assignments.

start this assignment very early, get a report done thats similar to mine 2 weeks before its due, send it to susan and ask her what you could add. if i had done this i wouldve got a 1.1, unfortunately i was kind of last minute so i did not afford myself this luxury. :)
